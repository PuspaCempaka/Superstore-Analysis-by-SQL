/* 
I create 2 tables to make it easier to create the queries for me.
In the first table:
1) Compute the total sales for each customer in the target year (in this case : 2017).
2) Use a ranking function to assign ranks or percentiles to each customer based on their total sales --> I use NTILE() to create the segments.
   note: The NTILE(100) divides the customers into 100 equal-sized percentiles.

In the second table, I categorize customers into the desired segments.

(SELECT Customer_ID, Customer_Name, ROUND(SUM(Sales),2) AS Total_Sales,
       NTILE(100) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(Sales) DESC) AS percentile
