/*
I create 3 tables to make my queries more easy to read and to shorten the syntax.
First table creates the monthly sales for each month in each year.
From this table, create second table to calculate the sales in same month in the previous year.
Third table, summarize all this information and calculate the MoM growth.
To specify the year, add "Where" clause,
